                            I am currently a student at the University of Texas at Dallas,
                            where I am immersed in my academic studies. I discovered my passion
                            for photography quite some time ago, beginning with still life
                            compositions, and I was fortunate enough to win several high school
                            competitions with my creative projects. After gaining valuable experience
                            by taking portraits for my friends, I am exicited to bring my passion
                            for photography into a new phase, where I can capture unforgettable
                            memories for people to cherish!
